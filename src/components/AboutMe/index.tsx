          Hey there, I'm Daniel, a 20-year-old with an insatiable thirst for learning 
          and lofty aspirations of becoming a Frontend Developer. Freshly graduated 
          from CKZIU w ZbÄ…szynku this year with a certification as an IT Technician, 
          my curiosity in coding, networking, and servers has been a long-standing 
          affair. While my journey into the world of coding is still unfolding, I'm 
          driven by the prospect of creating beautiful and interactive web experiences 
          that captivate users and solve real-world problems. Join me on my journey as 
          I work hard to turn my dreams into reality.`;
